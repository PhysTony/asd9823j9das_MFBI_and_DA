Obtain a table containing the following three fields for all individuals whose employee number is no greater than 10040:
- employee number
- the smallest department number among the departments where an employee has worked in (use a subquery to retrieve this
value from the 'dept_emp' table)
- assign '110022' as 'manager' to all individuals whose employee number is less than or equal to 10020, and '110039' to
those whose number is between 10021 and 10040 inclusive (use a CASE statement to create the third field).
If you've worked correctly, you should obtain an output containing 40 rows. 
Hereâ€™s the top part of the output.
